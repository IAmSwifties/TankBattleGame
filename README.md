### Versus Mode (Player vs. Player):

Two players compete against each other.

Victory is achieved by: 
1. Defeating the opponent (each player has three lives),

2. Destroying the opponent’s crystal tower (counts as one life)

3. Collecting 10 special energy points.

In addition, each player has a special skill called “Unlimited Bullets”, which removes the shooting cooldown.

The skill has a 15-second cooldown time, so use it wisely.
